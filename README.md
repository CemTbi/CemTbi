Hello

My name is Cem and I'm currently an A-levels student.

I've been programming for 3 years now and gained a significant knowledge in the Java programming language.
I'm pursuing a career as a Software Engineer since I ever heard of it.

When I got my first computer, I always asked myself "How does all this work?".
Whether opening an application or playing video games, the question was always there.
At those moments I didn't really thought more about it, but when I finally did my research,
I found programming.

-Algorithmics
-Cloud Computing
